The funny part about this first trip, is that because the planes was crowded, I didn't get to book my seat for the plane. As a result, Sheila's first flight was actually not with me, but with my family. My plane took off an hour later than Sheila's, but the next funny part, they'd just sat down at a restaurant my sister recommended, to eat laksa, and then I was there just 15 minutes after them. My flight was surprisingly faster than them for some reason, or maybe it was the landing and taxi/parking process that took longer for them.
