The funny part about this first trip, is that when we booked the plane tickets, my sister didn't book my seat because it was full. So my sister booked Mom, Dad, Her, and Sheila's seats, but not mine. As a result, Sheila's first flight was actually not with me, but with my family. My plane took off an hour later than Sheila's, but my flight was surprisingly faster than them for some reason. They had just sat down at a restaurant that's my sister's favorite, Curry Times, and then I was there just 15 minutes after them. Or maybe the landing and taxi/parking process took longer for them. But anyway, we ate some laksa and nasi lemak, and it was very delicious!

After that we got on the MRT to head to V-Lavender hotel, another staple in our family's trip to Singapore. We almost always chose this hotel because it's really convenient, it's right above the Lavender MRT station. And at the ground level, there are many shops to eat from. Like McDonald's, Burger King, a local bakery, and including my wife's favorite, Old Chang Kee.
