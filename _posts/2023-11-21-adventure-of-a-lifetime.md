# I would like to start with
the first post on my blog to be about my wife.

This year has been an adventure of a lifetime. So last year in December, I got married to a woman named Ozy Sheila Rafsani. It has been so fun. We go to so many places, eat so many food, experience so many feelings, and learn so many things.

Thank you for staying by my side. For trying so hard to be my friend. For cheering my heart when I need it.

I don't want to say too many things, I might write too much and go off-track. But I just want to say, sometimes I might not show it, but I really appreciate you. I will try my best to do the same, if not more. I'm proud of you and I love you, always ❤️

So here's some more pics of us so far!
