Recently browsed the web, and came across a forum post talking about Spore, the game by EA

Just a blast of nostalgia. I should write about games I ~~used~~ still love!

And perhaps I should record playing them again, if any of them are still available to play. I should document them while I still can.

# Games I Want To Talk About
1. Final Fantasy IX
2. Spyro
3. Mass Effect
4. Dragon Age
5. Divinity Original Sin 2
6. God of War
