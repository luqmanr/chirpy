# Heads-Ups!
This tutorial will use docker and docker compose commands. Also, use whatever IDE of your choice to write and deploy the codes below. Setting those up is beyond the scope of this tutorial, though I will mention my preferences throughout this blog post.

# Setting Up The Hardware

# Writing ESP8266 Code
## Reading From Ultrasonic Sensor
## Sending Data to MQTT Server

# Setting up The MQTT Server (If you want to deploy it yourself)
## Mosquitto Server
[Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is an open source MQTT/message broker that's easy to use and deploy. We will deploy the server with docker compose. Just create this service in your docker-compose
yml file

```
# Todo: code here
```

# Writing The Streamlit UI
## Implementing MQTT + Particles
## Making the Particles Interactive
