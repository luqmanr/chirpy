When I was still dating Sheila, on August 2023 the tickets for DPR Concert went on sale. DPR is one of Sheila's favorite K-POP group. She specifically likes Ian (as most people do LOL) as he was the most handsome in the group. She said she really wanted to watch it, but it would probably sell out within minutes! So I offered to buy it for her, as the internet connection at my office was quite quick and stable. Well also, her birthday's coming up on September, so I figured it could be her birthday present

Skip to 6th December, just a few days after the wedding, at the concert. It was a while since I watched a concert, and the atmosphere was very cool! It was our first concert together, and was a great new experience. Definitely a new experience getting to know each other. I'm glad we spent it together.
