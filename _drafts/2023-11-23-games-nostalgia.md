Recently browsed the web, and came across a forum post talking about Spore, the game by EA

Just a blast of nostalgia. I should write about games I ~~used~~ still love!

And perhaps I should record playing them again, if any of them are still available to play. I should document them while I still can.

# Games I Want To Talk About
1. Final Fantasy IX
2. Spyro
3. Mass Effect
4. Dragon Age
5. Divinity Original Sin 2
6. God of War
7. Trailmakers
8. Spore
9. Skyrim
10. Robocraft
11. DOTA
12. CS
13. Farming / Life sim -> Sheila tertarik Loftia
14. Knights of The Old Republic (KOTOR)
15. Valheim
16. Rocket League
17. Witcher
18. Tales of Series (and JRPG in general)
19. It Takes Two
20. Digimon World
21. Fire Emblem
22. Skate Sim

# Title choices
# honestly, it doesn't have to be interesting for the readers
# you're writing this because you want to journal your thoughts first
# if there's an audience for it, then that's secondary
1. My Farming Sim Experience -> Harus dikerucutkan, what is the thesis here, and why it's important
2. Why I love God of War
3. Divinity Original Sin 2, my experience
4. I love Lego-style/crafting games. I wish had more time to play them!
