I've been playing a lot of Trailmakers these past few weeks. Been playing with [@atobros]() sometimes at night, or during lunch break during workdays.

Playing this game reminds me of Spore and Valheim. I really like these types of games, where you can build anything basically, with your own _Lego Blocks_. The limit is only your imagination!

The reason I'm writing this, is because I just want to express how much such _"simple"_ games can be. I remember growing up playing Spore a lot. Not because I was doing the campaign, but I spent most of my time creating a lot of different species. I even made some Youtube videos, showcasing some of my builds back then. You can still watch the videos, I was obsessed with Ben 10 back then
