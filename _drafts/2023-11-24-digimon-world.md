# Digimon World
Work is so stressful and tiring. I'm always on the lookout for some music to ~~ease the pain~~ make the day and mood flow nicely, and my mind breezy.
That's when I came across [Digimon World LoFi by yoshi_UMR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqM8L6-dCn0&t=1732s&pp=ygUJeW9zaGlfdW1y) on YouTube,
and it was a blast to the past.

I remember that game so fondly. Even a few months ago, I tried up [Digimon World: Next Order](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/digimon/digimon-world-next-order) on the PS Vita (English Patched). It was pretty fun, but something about that game just didn't click with me (perhaps I'll talk more about that game in a nother post someday!).

So in this blog post, I would like to share, and document, try to recall and document my experience with it.
Ps. I won't try to look up any factual information on this game, it's all based on my recollection, so please cut me some slack on any wrong information about the game, lol!

# Talking Points
# 1. What is digimon world
Imagine the PS1-era games. Its pixelated 3D graphics, prerendered backgrounds, scratchy SFXs. Digimon World had all the qualities that makes a PS1-era game so iconic. 

It was back in the early 2000s Indonesia. Kids around me were playing Gameboys, SNES, PS1s, even thoguh it was already the PS2-era (which I didn't get until around 2007). I was so fascinated with the Digimon Anime back then. It aired new episodes weekly, on Sundays (don't quote me on that lol), so lots of kids in Indonesia was exposed to it, including my sister and I. So naturally, we watched and played a heck-ton of Digimon content back then. We even had the Digivices! a Digimon-themed Tamagotchi.

Back to the game, Digimon World was unique. We played a lot of JRPGs too back then, but it was unique, because we didn't really have _"control"_ over our Digimon, more like we could influence them to do something. 

# 3. What I Liked
Obviously a 7-9 year old kid still lives in their own heads most of the time. So for me, it was as if I was transported into the anime itself, and I genuinely had to care for my Digimon, and to find my way back to the real world.

I really liked how the digivolution system is obscure. Jijimon, the _"guide"_ in this game, will from time to time give some cryptic advice on how to progress the game. But I was a kid! So I didn't really knew how to progress other than just blindly pushing ahead. But that sense of discovery, the fact that everytime my Digimon would stop dead in its tracks, not knowing if it would either Digivolve, or die, I still remember those feelings. And I would get so excited if my Digimon showed the _"growing"_ bubble, and then I'd be disappointed if I got the same Digimon again, or Numemon! (which I think sucked back then, but was required to progress the game from time to time, lol)
