Finally, I'm switching from primarily Windows, to Linux! Because I currently left my PC at my office / old bedroom / my parent's house, I'm constantly remote-desktopping into it from my apartment. But remoting to a Windows machine is kind of annoying. I much prefer having access to servers via SSH as it's much simpler, and more importantly, no GUI related problems.

I've been looking around which Linux distribution I want to run, but then, I realized, it's much better to just run a _Hypervisor_, so I won't be bogged down by my would be choice of distribution. Any other services or apps I want to run that's better on certain distributions (or easier to manage/install), then I will just create another VM.

Obviously, there's going to be some performance impact, and there's sure to be problems (like the GPU partitioning or passthrough for gaming). But I want a new change, and want to explore these realms. Especially, I want to daily drive Linux instead of relying on Windows. So, here's for change!
